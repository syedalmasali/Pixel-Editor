# Pixel Editor

## Objective
In this program, I programmed image filters. These programs will manipulate digital images at the pixel level. Along the way, I used nested for loops, recursive functions, and understood how color is represented on computers. This program can Negate, Gray Scale, Rgb2gray, Binary, Sepia, Fairey, Mirror, Flip, and collect to a Photobooth of any image.
